Still in development, currently the lego inventor hub can only recieve messages from computer and process them synchronously directly 
in hub. It can do pretty much everything what is included in basic lego hub library, but user has to configure it in both
control_script side and Robot_script side. Its planned to asynchronously recieve and send information in the future.
